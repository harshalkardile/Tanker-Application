Cloud computing is on demand delivery of 
compute power, database storage, application
and other IT resources through a cloud service 
platform via internet with pay-as-you-go model

capex(capital expenditure)

capex includes in house servers 
(AD Server, DNS, Application), A/C, Swtiches, Cabeling, 
Router, Gateway, firwall, electricity. 
it reduces captial expenditure 
flexiblity to use cloud on demand for example
filpkart big billion day ind vs australlia mathces 

opex(operational expenditure)

opex includes hiring employess to work on maintains of servers
no need of hiring employess to work on 
cloud data centers to maintance
as we dont have to pay salary to them so theres is no operational expenditure


TOP cloud players
1) Aws,
2) Microsoft azure,
3) GCP.
4) Alibaba cloud.
5) Oracle, VMware, Fujitsu, IBM.

Aws

Charctristics of cloud
1) On demand self service -- anywhere and anytime access of data for ex gmail account custom increase of can be done
2) Broad network acess -- can be accessed from anywhere in network only need of internet
3) Scalability    -- flixibility grow and shrink on demand
4) resource Pooling -- pooling of resourses aggeregatively will be used as per need ( 500 individual water bottles together in pool).
5) Measured Services -- kind of analysis on data based on sales, matchces, traffic filteration based on male female most buyed products

Deployement model in cloud

1-> public cloud  (aws, azure, google) 
2-> private cloud (Enterprise cloud) made by specific company for their 
    requirements morely for securing confidential information
3-> hybrid cloud  (azure and aws hybrid) combination of both public and private cloud azure provides this models

Theory on Elastic cloud compute ie. EC2

virtual machine and ec2 is the same thing 

EC2 provides scalable compouting capacity in the aws cloud 
using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front
so one can develop and deploy application

ec2 enables you you to scale up or scale down to handle changes in requirements or 
spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forcast traffic

virtual server, virtual machine and virtual instance is same thing


one can use aws ec2 to lauch as many and as few virtual server as per need, 
configure security and networking and manage storage

Amazon EC2 anables scale up or scale down instances

Amazon EC2 is having two storage options ebs ( elastic block store ) located somewhere
else and instance store based on memory under host it fast and non persistent data can be deleted

preconfigured templates are there knows as amazon machine images such as ubuntu, windows, amazon linux

by default when one create ec2 instaces with amazon your account it limited to a maximum of 20 ec2 instances
per ec2 region with two default high input output instaces. one need to request amazon for more instances

Types of ec2 

there are total 7 types of ec2 6 important

1) general purpose -> series T, M, A
2) compute optimized -> series C
3) memory optimized -> series R, X, Z
4) storage optimized -> series I, D, H
5) accelerated computing/ gpu -> 
6) High memory optimized
7) previous genration 

general purpose 
USECASE: balanced of memory and cpu resources

compute optimized
USECASE: more cpu power than ram

memory optimized
USECASE: more ram than cpu

storage optimized
USECASE more storage than cpu and ram and low latency

accelerated computing/ gpu
USECASE: graphic optimized

High memory optimized
USECASE High ram than cpu based on nitro system

    These instaces provide a baseline level of CPU performance 
    with the ability to burst to a higher level when required by your workload.
    
    baseline meaning  5% to 40% of CPU performance

    Used when testing and development environments, low traffic websites and web 
    applications, microservices, and small databases.
